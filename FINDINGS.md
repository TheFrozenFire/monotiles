# Findings: Experimental Results from Monotile Exploration

Empirical results from running experiments on the hat monotile and its algebraic structure. These are things we measured, not things we read.

## Deflation Is Not a One-Way Function (#5)

The inflation/deflation asymmetry in the hat metatile substitution system does **not** constitute a computationally one-way function. Deflation is locally solvable.

### Results (hat and spectre, depth 3)

| Analysis | Hat | Spectre |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Full sibling adjacency | All tiles determined, radius ≤ 1 | All tiles determined, radius ≤ 1 |
| Inflation adjacency | All tiles determined, radius ≤ 4 | All tiles determined, radius ≤ 1 |
| Type-bag decomposition | Always unique (det(M) = -1) | Always unique (det(M) = 1) |
| Greedy deflation | 100% assignment rate | 100% assignment rate |

The asymmetry between inflation (O(n) local rule application) and deflation (recovering supertile boundaries) is **implementation convenience, not computational hardness**. A radius-1 neighborhood in the full sibling adjacency graph suffices to determine parent assignments for every tile.

The hat's inflation adjacency graph requires radius 4 because H-supertiles are disconnected in this sparser graph — some children lack intra-supertile neighbors. But this is an artifact of the graph choice, not an inherent barrier. The spectre, with its simpler 2-type system, resolves everything at radius 1 even with inflation adjacency.

## The Local-to-Global Gap Is All-or-Nothing (#6)

The gap between local indistinguishability and global rigidity in hierarchical substitution tilings closes as a **sharp phase transition**, not a gradual curve.

### Distinguishing advantage by radius (hat and spectre, depth 3)

| Radius | Hat Advantage | Spectre Advantage | Hat Normalized MI |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.000 |
| 1 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.001 |
| 2 | 1.0% | 0.0% | 0.055 |
| 3 (=depth) | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **1.000** |

At every radius below depth, advantage is ~0%. At radius = depth, it jumps to 100% in a single step. Both hat and spectre exhibit identical transition behavior.

### Why the transition is sharp

The substitution is **recursively self-similar**: the local structure within any finite subtree is fully determined by the subtree root's type, independent of what's above it in the hierarchy. Two tiles from different seeds but with the same ancestor chain up to level k are locally indistinguishable at radius k. Only when the chain reaches the seed does the difference become visible.

The BFS-based type signature makes this even starker: with sibling adjacency, a tile can determine its immediate parent type at radius 1, but **cannot determine any higher ancestor** regardless of radius. The adjacency graph is disconnected at supertile boundaries, creating an absolute information barrier.

### Ancestry determination (hat, depth 3, seed H)

| Level | Relation | Determined | Fraction |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Parent | 442/442 | 100% at radius 1 |
| 2 | Grandparent | 3/442 | 0.7% — nearly all undetermined |
| 3 | Seed | 442/442 | 100% (trivially, only one seed type) |

This demonstrates the BFS information barrier: sibling adjacency reveals parent type but nothing higher.

### Mutual information reveals partial structure

While distinguishing advantage is 0 for radii < depth, **mutual information** is nonzero starting at radius 1-2. The *distribution* of tiles across signatures varies by seed even when no individual signature is unique. A Bayesian observer gains partial information before the gap closes; a deterministic algorithm cannot.

### Connection to proximity gaps

The tiling gap is **dual** to the proximity gap in FRI/coding theory:
- **Proximity gap**: globally invalid → locally detectable (local tests are powerful)
- **Tiling gap**: globally different → locally undetectable until threshold (local observations are weak)

Both exhibit sharp transitions. The proximity gap makes the IOP verifier efficient; the tiling gap characterizes the cost of identification.

### Implications

The gap is **not suitable as a smooth hardness assumption** like LWE. It's a binary property: either you can see the seed (trivially easy) or you can't (information-theoretically impossible). More like a one-time pad than a lattice problem — unconditional but non-tunable.

For the IOP construction, this is ideal: the hierarchical commitment is unconditionally binding within any finite radius, and efficiency comes from the proximity gap on the proof side.

## Group Cryptography on Gamma = Z² ⋊ D₆ Is Not Viable (#8)

We tested three candidate hard problems for the Cucaracha's Coxeter group Gamma, motivated by the question of whether the tiling constraint could inject hardness into an otherwise tractable group.

### Cotiler Recovery

Given the cotiler group G_C (generated by pairwise quotients of tile positions), recover the cotiler C (up to translation).

| Size | Brute-force time | Solutions | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 0.00 ms | 1 | Trivial |
| 2 | ~0.2 ms | 1-2 | Fast |
| 3 | ~3 ms | 3 | Fast |
| 4 | ~50 ms | 2-4 | Manageable |
| 5 | ~6,000 ms | 1-5 | Exponential blowup begins |
| 6 | >31,000 ms | budget exceeded (10M nodes) | Combinatorial explosion |

The bottleneck is C(candidates, n-1) where candidates grow as ~n²×4. At size 6, the candidate pool reaches ~136 elements, giving C(136, 5) ≈ 500M subsets to check.

**Coset decomposition doesn't help.** We implemented a coset-based algorithm that groups candidates by their Z² translation component and backtracks over translation classes (at most 12 D₆ decorations each). Result: ~1.0x speedup across all sizes. The translation classes are too numerous — there are roughly as many classes as individual candidates, so the grouping provides no reduction.

### Region Decomposition (Exact Cover)

Given the covered cells (forgetting tile boundaries), recover which tiles placed them.

| Size | Mean time | Solutions | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1-20 | 0.00-0.07 ms | always exactly 1 | Linear scaling |

Trivially easy at all tested sizes. The Cucaracha's shape is sufficiently constrained that backtracking with a most-constrained-cell heuristic finds the unique decomposition almost immediately.

### Stabilizer Statistics

Compute the symmetry group of a random cotiler.

| Size | Trials | Trivial (|Stab|=1) | Threefold (|Stab|=3) |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1-20 | 10 each | 100% | 0% |

All 200 random cotilers tested had trivial stabilizer. The threefold symmetry (rotation by 120°) that is theoretically possible never appeared in random growth.

### Verdict

All three problems are easy or show only brute-force combinatorial hardness (not algebraic hardness). The virtually abelian structure of Gamma = Z² ⋊ D₆ makes group-theoretic hard problems (word problem, conjugacy problem) trivially solvable. The tiling constraint adds a geometric overlap check but does not create cryptographically useful hardness — it's an NP-style constraint satisfaction problem, not a one-way function.

The recovery scaling is exponential in cotiler size, but this is a consequence of naive subset enumeration over a polynomially-growing candidate pool, not of any deep algebraic structure. The coset comparison confirms this: exploiting the group's Z² ⋊ D₆ decomposition provides zero speedup because the hardness was never group-theoretic to begin with.
