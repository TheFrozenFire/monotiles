# Findings: Experimental Results from Monotile Exploration

Empirical results from running experiments on the hat monotile and its algebraic structure. These are things we measured, not things we read.

## The Local-to-Global Gap Is All-or-Nothing

The gap between local indistinguishability and global rigidity in hierarchical substitution tilings closes as a **sharp phase transition**, not a gradual curve. At every hierarchical radius below the depth, advantage is ~0% — no tile can determine which seed generated its tiling. At radius = depth, advantage jumps to 100% in a single step.

This is because the substitution is **recursively self-similar**: the local structure within any finite subtree is fully determined by the subtree root's type, independent of what's above it in the hierarchy. Two tiles from different seeds but with the same ancestor chain up to level k are locally indistinguishable at radius k. Only when the chain reaches the seed (radius = depth) does the difference become visible.

The BFS-based type signature (used in one-way analysis) makes this even starker: with sibling adjacency, a tile can determine its immediate parent type at radius 1, but **cannot determine any higher ancestor** regardless of radius. The adjacency graph is disconnected at supertile boundaries, creating an absolute information barrier. The only way to see past this barrier is to observe the hierarchy itself — the ancestor type chain.

This means the local-to-global gap is **information-theoretic, not computational**. It's not that determining the seed is *hard* — it's that the information simply isn't present in any finite local neighborhood of the base tiling. The gap closes the instant you can see the seed, and not one step sooner.

## Mutual Information Reveals Partial Structure Before the Gap Closes

While the distinguishing advantage (fraction of tiles with seed-unique signatures) is 0 for all radii below depth, the **mutual information** between seed and signature is nonzero starting at radius 1-2. This is because the *distribution* of tiles across signatures varies by seed, even when no individual signature is unique.

For example, in the hat system at depth 3: seeing grandparent type T rules out P-seed and F-seed (they don't produce T-type level-2 tiles at that depth), concentrating probability on H-seed and T-seed. This partial information shows up as positive mutual information even though no tile can deterministically identify its seed.

The gap between "zero advantage" and "positive mutual information" is the difference between **deterministic** and **probabilistic** distinguishability. A Bayesian observer gains information before the gap closes; a deterministic algorithm cannot.

## Group Cryptography on Gamma = Z² ⋊ D₆ Is Not Viable

We tested three candidate hard problems for the Cucaracha's Coxeter group Gamma, motivated by the question of whether the tiling constraint could inject hardness into an otherwise tractable group (Issue #8).

### Cotiler Recovery

Given the cotiler group G_C (generated by pairwise quotients of tile positions), recover the cotiler C (up to translation).

| Size | Brute-force time | Solutions | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 0.00 ms | 1 | Trivial |
| 2 | ~0.2 ms | 1-2 | Fast |
| 3 | ~3 ms | 3 | Fast |
| 4 | ~50 ms | 2-4 | Manageable |
| 5 | ~6,000 ms | 1-5 | Exponential blowup begins |
| 6 | >31,000 ms | budget exceeded (10M nodes) | Combinatorial explosion |

The bottleneck is C(candidates, n-1) where candidates grow as ~n²×4. At size 6, the candidate pool reaches ~136 elements, giving C(136, 5) ≈ 500M subsets to check.

**Coset decomposition doesn't help.** We implemented a coset-based algorithm that groups candidates by their Z² translation component and backtracks over translation classes (at most 12 D₆ decorations each). Result: ~1.0x speedup across all sizes. The translation classes are too numerous — there are roughly as many classes as individual candidates, so the grouping provides no reduction.

### Region Decomposition (Exact Cover)

Given the covered cells (forgetting tile boundaries), recover which tiles placed them.

| Size | Mean time | Solutions | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1-20 | 0.00-0.07 ms | always exactly 1 | Linear scaling |

Trivially easy at all tested sizes. The Cucaracha's shape is sufficiently constrained that backtracking with a most-constrained-cell heuristic finds the unique decomposition almost immediately.

### Stabilizer Statistics

Compute the symmetry group of a random cotiler.

| Size | Trials | Trivial (|Stab|=1) | Threefold (|Stab|=3) |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1-20 | 10 each | 100% | 0% |

All 200 random cotilers tested had trivial stabilizer. The threefold symmetry (rotation by 120°) that is theoretically possible never appeared in random growth.

### Verdict

All three problems are easy or show only brute-force combinatorial hardness (not algebraic hardness). The virtually abelian structure of Gamma = Z² ⋊ D₆ makes group-theoretic hard problems (word problem, conjugacy problem) trivially solvable. The tiling constraint adds a geometric overlap check but does not create cryptographically useful hardness — it's an NP-style constraint satisfaction problem, not a one-way function.

The recovery scaling is exponential in cotiler size, but this is a consequence of naive subset enumeration over a polynomially-growing candidate pool, not of any deep algebraic structure. The coset comparison confirms this: exploiting the group's Z² ⋊ D₆ decomposition provides zero speedup because the hardness was never group-theoretic to begin with.
